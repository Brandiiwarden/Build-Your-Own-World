# Build-Your-Own-World
This is a large design project that required working through every stage of development, from ideation to presentation. The goal of this project was to learn how to handle a larger piece of code with little starter code in the hopes of emulating something like a product development cycle.
Objective: Design and implement a 2D tile-based world exploration engine, in which the user will be able to explore by walking around and interacting with objects in that world.
